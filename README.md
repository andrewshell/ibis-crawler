# ibis-crawler
Script to crawl [ibis.makethingsmakesense.com](https://ibis.makethingsmakesense.com/) and export as [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) graph.

I hypothesize that an outliner-wiki like LogSeq or Roam Research would be an excellent UI for authoring documents with linked data.

I'm currently playing around with these tools and figuring out the best way to structure things, so it makes sense as a graph but can also be parsed by a script and exported in HTML using something like RDFa.

Down the road, either as a LogSeq plugin or as a new standalone app, the outliner would know about ontologies and how the documents relate to each other so the app could infer additional information.
